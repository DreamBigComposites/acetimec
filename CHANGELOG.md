# Changelog

* Unreleased
    * Add support for plain UTC timezone in `AtcTimeZone`.
        * Create pre-defined `atc_time_zone_utc` instance.
    * Move `AtcZonedExtra` factory functions to `AtcTimeZone`.
        * Simplify initialization sequence of `AtcZoneProcessor` by channeling
          all factory operations through `AtcTimeZone`.
    * Create `zonedbtesting` subset for unit tests.
    * High resolution zonedb
        * Support one-second resolution for Zone.UNTIL and Rule.AT fields.
            * Enables support all zones before ~1972.
        * Support one-minute resolution for Zone.DSTOFF (i.e. Zone.RULES) and
          Rule.SAVE fields.
            * Handles a few zones around ~1930 whose DSTOFF is a 00:20 minutes,
            instead of a multiple of 00:15 minutes.
        * Extend year interval of `zonedb/` to `[1800,10000)`, which is
          slightly larger than the raw TZDB year range of `[1844,2087]` (as of
          TZDB 2022g).
        * Increases flash consumption by roughly 100%, 40kB to 80kB on 32-bit
          processors.
        * The old format still available through `-D ATC_HIRES_ZONEDB=0`.
        * Validation program `validate_against_libc/` shows that transitions
          are identical to the C libc library for all zones, for all years
          `[1800,2100)`.
    * MemoryBenchmark
        * Use my Arduino MemoryBenchmark infrastructure to extract flash and
          static memory consumption of the AceTimeC library across various
          microcontrollers.
        * The library does not support `PROGMEM` so AVR and ESP8266 processors
          consume excessive RAM.
    * Always generate anchor rules in zonedb.
        * Allows `zone_processor.c` to work over all years `[0,10000)`
          even with truncated zonedb (e.g. `[2000,2100)`).
        * Accuracy is guaranteed only for the requested interval (e.g.
          `[2000,2100)`.
        * But the code won't crash outside of that interval.
* 0.7.0 (2023-02-12, TZDB 2022g)
    * Links
        * Remove `kAtcLinkRegistry` and support for thin links.
        * Add `target_info` field to `AtcZoneInfo` to unify fat and symbolic
          links.
    * Replace `AtcZoneInfo.letter` with `letter_index`.
        * All letter fields are now indexes into `AtcZoneContext.letters` array,
          even the one-character letters.
    * New directory structure, similar to AceTimeGo library
        * `src/ace_time_c/` -> `src/acetimec/`
        * `src/ace_time_c/zone_info.h` -> `src/zoneinfo/*`
        * `src/ace_time_c/zone_info_utils.h` -> `src/zoneinfo/*`
        * `src/ace_time_c/zonedb/` -> `src/zonedb/`
    * Validation
        * Create `examples/validate_against_libc` to validate against the libc
          time functions.
    * examples/
        * Add `-D _GNU_SOURCE` flag to gain access to `gm_gmtoff` field
          in `struct tm`.
        * Allows validation of total UTC offset against the GNU libc library.
* 0.6.0 (2023-01-17, TZDB 2022g)
    * Migrate to ACUnit v0.1.0.

        * Incorporate same algorithm as AceTime
        * Unify `find_by_epochseconds()` and `find_by_local_date_time()` using a
          common `FindResult`.
        * Fix handling of input and output `fold` parameters during overlap in
          `find_by_local_date_time()`.
    * `AtcLocalDateTime`
        * Incorporate `fold` parameter, for consistency with `AtcOffsetDateTime`
          and `AtcZonedDateTime`.
        * Removes the explicit `uint8_t fold` argument from a number of
          functions, simplifying their usage.
        * More consistent with the AceTime library.
    * `AtcZonedExtra`
        * Add requested STD offset and DST offset, information which was
          otherwise lost during a DST gap.
        * Add `type` parameter to indicate exact match, gap, or overlap.
    * `AtcTimeZone`
        * Add `AtcTimeZone` struct to simplify arguments to various
          `atc_zoned_date_time*()` and `atc_zoned_extra*()` functions
    * printing to `AtcStringBuffer`
        * Change order of various `atc_xxx_print()` functions to place the
          date-time objects first, like the `this` pointer of an object.

    * Configurable current epoch year
        * Rename `atc_set_local_epoch_year()` and `atc_get_local_epoch_year()`
          to `atc_set_current_epoch_year()` and `atc_get_current_epoch_year()`,
          consistent with AceTime library.
        * Rename `atc_local_valid_year_lower()` and
          `atc_local_valid_year_upper()` to `atc_epoch_valid_year_lower()` and
          `atc_epoch_valid_year_uppper()`, consistent with AceTime library.
