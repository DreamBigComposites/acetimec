/**
 * An internal simplified version of the AtcDateTime class that uses the
 * (year_tiny, month, day, minutes, suffix) fields.
 *
 * The order of 'minutes' and 'suffix' are reversed from the DateTuple class in
 * the AceTime library because C does not support constructors, so the
 * initializer list must be in the same order as the field order. But I have a
 * bunch of code ported from the C++ code in AceTime which assumes that
 * 'minutes' comes before 'suffix'. So it is easier to fix the ordering here.
 *
 * This causes the field alignment to be slightly less than ideal, but the class
 * already consumes 2 x 4-byte slots on 32-bit processors, so the new ordering
 * does not change the overall sizeof(AtcDateTuple).
